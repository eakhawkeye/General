Fully automated version of [Steve Jenkis](https://www.stevejenkins.com/blog/2014/09/how-to-manually-update-bash-to-patch-shellshock-bug-on-older-fedora-based-systems/)'s Shell Shock fix procedure. Created this a few years ago and submitted it to Steve as I used this to resolve the security issue on hundreds of hosts, keeping them live in the process.
